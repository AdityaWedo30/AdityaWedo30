### 🔭 About Me

I am a developer focused on building web and mobile applications, with a strong emphasis on frontend development and UI/UX design. My interests include creating simple yet functional user interfaces using Figma and developing Android frontends with Kotlin. I also have basic knowledge of backend development, though not at a professional level. I enjoy designing engaging user experiences and contributing to open-source projects.
